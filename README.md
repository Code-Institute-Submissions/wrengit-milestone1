# ruhstik. - A wedding planning service
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

A website to act as an initial information portal for prospective clients interested in a wedding planning service. Designed to act as a 'hook' to showcase the ethos of the company, whilst not overloading the user with too much information.

## UX
The site is designed to focus on couples looking for a wedding planning service that stands out from the tradtional planning services. The ethos of the buisness is 'customer first', working closely with clients to deliver an event to remember. The service is pitched at young, design concious couples that will likely be viewing the site initially on a mobile device.

The colour palete was keptsublte, with minimal 'clutter' and clear, readable text. 

The user is guided through the single scolling page, to arrive at a contact form at the bottom. This aligns with the strategy of the site in active as an initial hook, and allows the user to submit contact information with out feeling like they have to commit. The buisness can follow up with a personalised email to sell the service. 

Links to the business' social media pages (demo links forward to the main social media home page) are prominantly displayed at the top of the page (desktop view) and in the drop down navbar (mobile view). This allows users to view more specific information in a suitable format (Instagram for images of previous events, Facebook to see 'blog' or text posts etc), whilst maintaining their attention.

Users can see what the buinsess is about, read testimonials from previous clients, and read about example events that the business has previously organised. This gives a good feel for what they can expect from working with the business. Social media links, a contact form, a physical location and phone number, and a contact email cover all methods of communicating should the user wish to proceed.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
The target audience will likely be initially viewing the site on a mobile device. The parallax images found on the desktop site will not render on a mobile browser, so the images are changed to sticky. This gives the site an improve look over fixed images on a mobile browser. The parallax images are left to the desktop site only. 

### Features Left to Implement
Suggestions on the mobile site to visit the desktop site, with more information available better suited for the larger screen size. An in-site gallery, based on the portfolio modal pop-ups would keep the site neat whilst providing a better user experience.
